# 02 - Variable

## Declare a variable

```go
var myVar string
```

## Declare and initialize a variable 

```go
var myString string = "hello"
```

## Use the short variable declaration to declare a variable and initialize it

The `:=` operator infers the type of the new variable based on the value.
So with this operator, no need to declare the type of the variable.

```go
myString := "hello"
```

## Declare several variables in one line

We can declare one or several variables in a single line.

```go
name, age := "Aurelie", 39
```
